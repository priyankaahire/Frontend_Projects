            Smoke Testing is a software testing technique performed post software build to verify that the critical
            functionalities of software are working fine. It is executed before any detailed functional or regression
            tests are executed. The main purpose of smoke testing is to reject a software application with defects so
            that QA team does not waste time testing broken software application.
